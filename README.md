## Setup

- Clone this repository to your machine
- Go into the project's root directory, and run the command `npm install`.
- Run the test suite using the cammand `npm test`.

- If  the command `npm test` does not work, you may need to install mocha globally on your machine.
- Do this with the comand `npm install -g mocha`.

## Lessons learned working on this project

- I learned how to use Chai's assertion syntax for unit tests.
- I learned hoe to use VS code.
